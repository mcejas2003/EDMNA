# EDMNA
Software application of numerical methods (Euler, Heun and finite differences) coded in Python and MatLab, as well as the graph in LaTeX and interactive graph in Python through matplotlib package.
Also I include LaTeX graphs of the solution of an _initial value problem_ through Euler and Heun numerical method.

## Procedure
The first aproach to the challenge was using MatLab as a reccomendation of our professor. Through it we obtained as an output that we pasted in an _.txt_ file for each lenght of step.
Worked with LaTeX through overleaf.com free plan reading _.txt_ documents with the coordinates in an specific format that LaTeX could work with.
Later on, I code it on python with the same logic, as python is much simpler and powerful, it was much simpler and we didn't have the necesity to output a coordinates file as before. We plotted the resulting solution through matplotlib python package.
